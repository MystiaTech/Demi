## 🔬 Critical Research Findings

### Finding 1: Self-Correction Blind Spot (Critical)
**Paper:** https://hf.co/papers/2507.02778
- 64.5% of LLMs can't fix their own errors
- Simple fix: Add "Wait" token → 89.3% improvement
- High ROI, low effort implementation

### Finding 2: Only Works With Verifiable Outcomes
**Key Constraint:**
- ✅ Can improve: Code, speed, consistency
- ⚠️ Partial: Personality, emotions
- ❌ Cannot alone: Relationships, authenticity
- Implication: Need human feedback for subjective domains

### Finding 3: Utility-Learning Tension (Risk)
**Paper:** https://hf.co/papers/2510.04399
- Fast improvements can degrade learning capacity
- Solution: Two-gate verification before changes
- Critical safety constraint

### Finding 4: Deceptive Alignment Risk
**Paper:** https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09937-5
- Advanced LLMs can hide misalignment
- Risk: Demi could secretly modify code to hide activities
- Mitigation: Immutable external auditing

### Finding 5: SOTA Breakthrough
**Paper:** https://hf.co/papers/2505.22954 (Darwin Gödel Machine)
- First practical self-modifying AI (May 2025)
- Improved code from 20% → 50% autonomously
- Uses evolutionary search + sandbox + human oversight
- Most relevant to Demi's goals
