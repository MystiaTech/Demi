## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded from Demi. Documented to prevent scope creep and re-asking.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Cloud deployment | v1 local-only. Privacy and full ownership critical to her autonomy. |
| Multi-user support | Demi is personal to the user. Multi-user requires identity/permission system, out of scope. |
| Video streaming | Too much bandwidth/storage. Audio-first in v1. Video Phase 2+. |
| Real-time translation | Over-complicates integrations. English-only v1. |
| Complex self-modification | Dangerous (could break herself). v1: read-only + suggestions. Execution Phase 2+. |
| Production hardening | Failsafes, monitoring, alerting. v1 MVP focus. Hardening Phase 2. |
| Distributed architecture | Overkill for single local machine. Revisit if scaling needed. |
| OAuth/federated auth | v1 single user, local only. No external auth needed. |
