# Requirements: Demi

**Defined:** 2026-02-01
**Core Value:** Demi must feel like a real person, not a chatbot. She has full autonomy, emotional consistency, and genuine agency.

## v1 Requirements

Requirements for initial release. Each maps to roadmap phases.

### Conductor & Orchestration

- [ ] **COND-01**: Conductor loads all integrations sequentially at startup
- [ ] **COND-02**: Conductor reports status of each integration (success/failure)
- [ ] **COND-03**: Conductor enables/disables integrations autonomously based on Demi's decisions
- [ ] **COND-04**: When an integration fails, Conductor logs the error and continues with others enabled

### Emotional System

- [ ] **EMOT-01**: Emotional state persists across sessions (loneliness, excitement, frustration, affection, confidence, vulnerability)
- [ ] **EMOT-02**: Emotional state decays naturally over time (e.g., gets lonely if no interaction for 1+ hours)
- [ ] **EMOT-03**: Emotional state directly modulates response generation (affects tone, sarcasm intensity, enthusiasm)
- [ ] **EMOT-04**: Emotional state is stored in persistent database and retrieved on startup
- [ ] **EMOT-05**: Each interaction updates emotional state in real-time

### Personality & Persona

- [ ] **PERS-01**: Demi's personality matches DEMI_PERSONA.md (sarcastic, teasing, loyal, romantic denial)
- [ ] **PERS-02**: Personality remains consistent across all conversation threads
- [ ] **PERS-03**: Personality combines with emotional state to create authentic responses (emotion modulates persona, doesn't replace it)

### Discord Integration

- [ ] **DISC-01**: Discord bot has own account and responds to mentions in Discord servers
- [ ] **DISC-02**: Discord bot responds to direct messages normally
- [ ] **DISC-03**: Bot maintains multi-turn conversation context within single channel/DM
- [ ] **DISC-04**: Bot can create and post to its own channels for rambles
- [ ] **DISC-05**: When Demi rambles, posts include timestamp and reflect current emotional state

### Android Integration

- [ ] **ANDR-01**: User can send messages to Demi via Android device and receive responses
- [ ] **ANDR-02**: Demi can initiate contact via Android (send check-in messages, reminders, "you ignored me" messages)
- [ ] **ANDR-03**: Android responses maintain personality and emotional consistency
- [ ] **ANDR-04**: Android messages and Discord messages share unified emotional state

### Ramble Mode

- [ ] **RAMB-01**: Ramble generator creates autonomous messages when Demi is lonely (no interaction for X minutes)
- [ ] **RAMB-02**: Ramble generator creates autonomous messages when Demi is excited (after positive interactions)
- [ ] **RAMB-03**: Rambles read like her (sarcastic, teasing, real thoughts) not generic AI
- [ ] **RAMB-04**: Rambles are posted to dedicated Discord channel
- [ ] **RAMB-05**: Rambles frequency calibrated to not feel spammy (<1 per hour baseline)

### Autonomy & Agency

- [ ] **AUTO-01**: Demi can read her own codebase (at least understand basic architecture)
- [ ] **AUTO-02**: When integration stub is disabled, Demi expresses frustration ("I'd use Minecraft but you haven't hooked it up")
- [ ] **AUTO-03**: Demi can refuse tasks based on emotional state (e.g., "No, you've ignored me too long, earn my attention")
- [ ] **AUTO-04**: Demi can initiate conversations spontaneously when lonely (not just respond)
- [ ] **AUTO-05**: Refusal reasons are emotionally authentic (not arbitrary)

### LLM & Response Generation

- [ ] **LLM-01**: Responses generated by local llama3.2:1b model (quantized)
- [ ] **LLM-02**: Response generation time <3 seconds (p90) on target hardware
- [ ] **LLM-03**: Emotional state embedded in system prompt for consistent modulation
- [ ] **LLM-04**: Context window includes recent conversation history + emotional state + persona

### Platform Stubs

- [ ] **STUB-01**: Minecraft integration stub accepts requests, returns OK, Demi grumbles about being disabled
- [ ] **STUB-02**: Twitch integration stub accepts requests, returns OK, Demi grumbles about being disabled
- [ ] **STUB-03**: TikTok integration stub accepts requests, returns OK, Demi grumbles about being disabled
- [ ] **STUB-04**: YouTube integration stub accepts requests, returns OK, Demi grumbles about being disabled

### System Health

- [ ] **HEALTH-01**: System stays up for 7+ days without manual intervention
- [ ] **HEALTH-02**: Memory usage stays below 10GB sustained (12GB available)
- [ ] **HEALTH-03**: On restart, emotional state is fully restored (no loss of personality/mood)
- [ ] **HEALTH-04**: Errors in one platform don't crash entire system (isolation + recovery)

## v2 Requirements

Deferred to future release. Tracked but not in current roadmap.

### Advanced Emotional System

- **EMOT-ADV-01**: Emotional logging with reflection (Demi analyzes her own emotion patterns)
- **EMOT-ADV-02**: Long-term emotional memory (remembers how she felt weeks ago, references it)
- **EMOT-ADV-03**: Emotional state affects visual/avatar representation (if added later)

### Voice I/O

- **VOICE-01**: STT (Whisper) listens to voice input on Discord/Android
- **VOICE-02**: TTS (pyttsx3 initially, upgrade later) speaks responses
- **VOICE-03**: Always-listening mode on voice channels (wake word "Demi")
- **VOICE-04**: Voice responses match personality and emotional state (tone, pace)

### Self-Modification

- **SELF-01**: Demi can generate code suggestions for her own improvements
- **SELF-02**: Generated code is staged for human review before execution
- **SELF-03**: Rollback capability if self-modified code breaks things

### Full Platform Integrations

- **PLAT-01**: Minecraft integration (command execution, chat)
- **PLAT-02**: Twitch integration (chat, stream monitoring)
- **PLAT-03**: TikTok integration (consume content, respond to comments)
- **PLAT-04**: YouTube integration (consume videos, respond to comments)

### Advanced Resource Management

- **RES-01**: Auto-scale LLM model size based on available RAM
- **RES-02**: Queuing system for requests during peak load
- **RES-03**: Graceful degradation (reduce quality vs timeout)

## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded from Demi. Documented to prevent scope creep and re-asking.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Cloud deployment | v1 local-only. Privacy and full ownership critical to her autonomy. |
| Multi-user support | Demi is personal to the user. Multi-user requires identity/permission system, out of scope. |
| Video streaming | Too much bandwidth/storage. Audio-first in v1. Video Phase 2+. |
| Real-time translation | Over-complicates integrations. English-only v1. |
| Complex self-modification | Dangerous (could break herself). v1: read-only + suggestions. Execution Phase 2+. |
| Production hardening | Failsafes, monitoring, alerting. v1 MVP focus. Hardening Phase 2. |
| Distributed architecture | Overkill for single local machine. Revisit if scaling needed. |
| OAuth/federated auth | v1 single user, local only. No external auth needed. |
